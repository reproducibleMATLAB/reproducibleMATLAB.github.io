# Privacy Policy {.unnumbered}

This site collects no user data.

It does use Google analytics to aid in measuring the impact and usage of the materials but does not use cookies to do so.

Measuring usage of **repliMAT** allows us to potentially apply for future funding as well as finding out which sections are most popular, allowing us to use our efforts to the best effect.

Please see the [source code](https://github.com/reproducibleMATLAB/reproducibleMATLAB.github.io/){target='_blank'} to see that anonymity settings are enabled in the quarto config  (`_quarto.yml`) - which is used to generate the site. Namely this section:

```yml
  google-analytics: 
    . . .
    anonymize-ip: true
    storage: none
```

Online privacy is important to us. If you have any concerns about privacy when using **repliMAT** - please contact David Wilby.
